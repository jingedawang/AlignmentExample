# AlignmentExample

This repository contains a series of examples showing how to solve the alignment problems in vectorization.

Here is the order it appears in the blog.

1. unaligned_vectorization.cpp
2. aligned_vectorization.cpp
3. encapsulated_vectorization.cpp
4. unaligned_heap_vectorization.cpp
5. aligned_heap_vectorization.cpp
6. malicious_aligned_heap_vectorization.cpp
7. antimalicious_aligned_heap_vectorization.cpp
